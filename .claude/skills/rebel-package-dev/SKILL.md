# Developing a Laravel Rebel package

You are extending a package in the **Laravel Rebel** enterprise-auth suite. Follow this exactly.

## The loop (per sub-task)
1. **Write the test first** (Pest + Testbench): happy path, **auth/fail-closed**, tenant-scoping,
   empty state. Run `composer test`.
2. Implement with the conventions: `declare(strict_types=1)`, `final` classes, constructor
   promotion, English docblocks.
3. Make the gate green: `composer test` · `composer phpstan` (**level max**) · `composer pint -- --test`.
4. Commit on the feature branch. Repeat.

## PHPStan level max — fix the cause, never suppress
Forbidden: `@phpstan-ignore*`, baseline entries, `assert()`/inline `@var` to override inference,
type-casts/`mixed` widening just to silence. Instead:
- Narrow before casting: `is_scalar($x) ? (string) $x : null`.
- `json_decode($s, true)` returns `array<array-key, mixed>` — type/annotate accordingly.
- `app()->make('request')` is typed `Illuminate\Http\Request` (no redundant `instanceof`).
- `cursor()` for memory-safe scans; `withoutGlobalScopes()` for cross-tenant admin reads.
- Nested Eloquent `where(fn ($q) => …)` closures receive `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder`.
- Larastan's view-string rule → return `response()->view('ns::x', $data)`.
- `Aal::tryFrom()` (fail-closed), not `from()`. Add `@property` blocks to Eloquent models.
- Run with `--memory-limit=512M`.

## Security & telemetry (non-negotiable)
- Identifiers/IP/User-Agent are **keyed HMACs** (core `KeyedHasher`); never cleartext PII. Never
  log OTPs/secrets (audit metadata is sanitized by `Redactor`).
- Record events through the core `AuditLogger` (persisted to `rebel_auth_events`; configurable
  **sync|queue**, Horizon-ready). For a channel/driver/bridge, capture **all** panel telemetry —
  sends (`channel.verification.started`), **delivery receipts** (`.delivered`/`.undelivered` from
  the provider status webhook), cost, country (`CF-IPCountry` header), devices/sessions. Leave a
  field empty only if unsupported, and show an honest empty state.

## Definition of Done (per change)
- One feature branch → one PR to `main`; CI matrix **PHP 8.3/8.4/8.5 × Laravel 12/13** green.
- README + CHANGELOG updated; squash-merge.
- **Release every change:** `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z` + `gh release create`.
  Stay within `0.1.x` (`^0.1` excludes `0.2.0`). CI pins BOTH `illuminate/contracts` and
  `illuminate/support`; `composer check` uses `pint --test`.

## Tooling notes
- `php`/`node`/`composer` run in PowerShell (Herd), not the Bash tool.
- spatie `hasAssets()` publishes to `public/vendor/{shortName}` (the short name strips `laravel-`).
- Package migrations load by filename order — don't let an `add_*` migration sort before its
  `create_*` (merge the column into `create_*` for 0.x, or prefix to sort after).
- Test OTP/email flows with Mailtrap, or `MAIL_MAILER=log` to read codes from the log.
